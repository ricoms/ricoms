### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning building Intelligent Systems. So all about MLOps, DevOps and Machine Learning frameworks I would love to know! Some technologies that I'm digging into right now are:
1. https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow
2. https://github.com/iterative/cml
3. https://github.com/jina-ai/jina
4. https://github.com/airbnb/knowledge-repo
4. https://github.com/dsys/match
4. https://github.com/andresionek91/airflow-autoscaling-ecs
5. https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize
5. https://github.com/visenger/awesome-mlops


- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on research projects, Machine Learning algorithms and MLOps technologies. I also enjoy event organization with a focus on individual technological empowerment.

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with learning and applying Kubeflow and Tensorflow Javascript.

- âš¡ Fun fact: I worked as a Hotel Manager.
