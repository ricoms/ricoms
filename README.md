### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as a Senior Research and Development Analyst at Dafiti Group and Udacity's reviewer for Machine Learning and Deep Learning Nanodegrees.
I voluntarily organize(d) events for open source data science-related technology, and Iâ€™m the main organizer for PyData SÃ£o Paulo.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning building Intelligent Systems. So all about MLOps, DevOps and Machine Learning frameworks I would love to know! Some technologies that I'm digging into right now are:
1. https://github.com/kubeflow/kubeflow
2. https://github.com/iterative/cml
3. https://github.com/jina-ai/jina
4. https://github.com/airbnb/knowledge-repo
4. https://github.com/dsys/match
4. https://github.com/andresionek91/airflow-autoscaling-ecs
4. https://medium.com/@willian.fuks/bad5eb2a9cdd
5. https://github.com/MaterializeInc/materialize
5. https://github.com/visenger/awesome-mlops


- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on research projects, Machine Learning algorithms and MLOps technologies. I also enjoy event organization with a focus on individual technological empowerment.

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with learning and applying Kubeflow and Tensorflow Javascript.
